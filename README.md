# PhD Career Outcomes Dashboard

This interactive dashboard was built using R, Flexdashboard, and Plotly to visualize and explore the career outcomes of PhD graduates from a fictitious university. The project addresses the common need for academic departments to understand and showcase the diverse career paths of their alumni.

This demonstration showcases my end-to-end ability to:

-   **Develop Advanced Dashboards:** Structuring a complex, multi-tab layout with a sidebar for global filtering using `flexdashboard`.
-   **Implement Linked Visualizations:** Using the `crosstalk` package to allow a single dropdown menu to dynamically filter multiple, independent plots across the dashboard.
-   **Perform Data Aggregation and Analysis:** Processing raw graduate data in R to calculate summaries by cohort, department, and other characteristics before visualization.
-   **Create Rich Data-Driven Stories:** Designing a series of targeted charts (stacked bars, choropleth maps, horizontal bars) to answer specific questions about job sectors, institutional types, and geography.

The result is a clean, professional, and powerful tool that transforms a complex dataset into an accessible and interactive resource for faculty, prospective students, and administrators.
