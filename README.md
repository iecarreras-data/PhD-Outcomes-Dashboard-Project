# PhD Career Outcomes Dashboard

This dashboard, built with R, Flexdashboard, and Plotly, addresses the common need for academic departments to understand and showcase the diverse career paths of their alumni. It provides a clean, professional, and powerful resource for faculty, prospective students, and administrators.

### Data Simulation & Methodology

To ensure privacy while demonstrating full functionality, this dashboard is built upon an entirely synthetic dataset. This process highlights a critical skill in modern data science:

-   **Generative AI for Data Simulation:** Used GenAI to create a realistic, high-fidelity dataset that accurately mimics the structure, distributions, and complexity of real-world PhD career outcomes. This enables robust development and demonstration without exposing any sensitive personal information.

### Core Competencies Showcased

This project demonstrates my end-to-end ability to:

-   **Develop Advanced Dashboards:** Structuring a complex, multi-tab layout with a sidebar for global filtering using `flexdashboard`.
-   **Implement Linked Visualizations:** Using the `crosstalk` package to allow a single dropdown menu to dynamically filter multiple, independent plots across the dashboard.
-   **Perform Data Aggregation and Analysis:** Processing raw graduate data in R to calculate summaries by cohort, department, and other characteristics before visualization.
-   **Create Rich Data-Driven Stories:** Designing a series of targeted charts (stacked bars, choropleth maps, horizontal bars) to answer specific questions about job sectors, institutional types, and geography.

The result is a powerful tool that transforms a complex dataset into an accessible and interactive platform for strategic decision-making.
